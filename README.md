# CV is outdated
# Here is my Motivation Letter

Hi, 

  I am Cir. I am 20. I live in Leipzig, Germany. I have worked for a year with NodeJs and React. I feel ok to use it, but I am oen to everything new as well. Last month I spent in learning and practising with Data structeres and algorithm. 
  
  I have any bachelor degree. Furthermore, I study publish deal. But I have visited several hackatons and spoken with different developers. I notice that 30 - 35 % of theme are self-taught persons. 
  
  I enjoy sience. I read books about universe and space, theory of Darvin, physic in our world and I feel amazing. I am so 
encouraged to try something in practice. What else ? Ohhh, my hobby. I enjoy football and tennis. Soccer is team game, that is why I like it so much. You need not just see your colleagues, but fell them as well.  

  I am fast in learning everything what interest me. And I like to work together. I want to be helpful as much as possible. 
I hate tasks which I did often in the past and find easy them. It is so much boring and I will be fast tried. Serious tasks isanother deal. Sometimes I like to dream, to dream like designer. It is too easy. You just need to find any thing or product
that is not comfortable or effective as for you mind. Than you think how to make it better and for whom. It is like a game. 
I enjoy to play the game listening to music at the same time. I am fun but may be not at first meeting. I need to adopt.
Hope, you are open to new member.

  I have thought a lot about my expactation. I come that the most desirable is experience. Experience not only with my skills, but with new persons as well. They both are the most wished. Also I want find place for my ideas. They are so different. Here we stop.
  
Best Regards,
Ciril Stas`
