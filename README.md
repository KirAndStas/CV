Here is my CV

Hi, 

  I am Cir and I am going to become the master in FullStack Development. What is FullStack Development ? Ok, for me it is 
AngularJS and Node.JS. I agree if you say that I am wrong, but now I am not talking about HTML or CSS and additional and 
helpful tools. I am about FRONTEND & BACKEND part of web development. There are many other toolkits for web, but I find 
these two as the most comfortable and effective. Of course, It is only my opinion. 

  I have any bachelor degree. Furthermore, I study publish deal. But I have visited several hackatons and spoken with different developers. I notice that 30 - 35 % of theme are self-taught persons. 
  
  I enjoy sience. I read books about universe and space, theory of Darvin, physic in our world and I feel amazing. I am so 
encouraged to try something in practice. What else ? Ohhh, my hobby. I enjoy football and tennis. Soccer is team game, that iswhy I like it so much. You need not just see your colleagues, and fell them as well.  

  I am fast in learning everything what interest me. And I like to work together. I want to be helpful as much as possible. 
I hate tasks which I did often in the past and find easy them. It is so much boring and I will be fast tried. Serious tasks isanother deal. Sometimes I like to dream, to dream like designer. It is too easy. You just need to find any thing or product
that is not comfortable or effective as for you mind. Than you think how to make it better and for whom. It is like a game. 
I enjoy to play the game listening to music at the same time. I am fun but not may be not at first meeting. I need to adopt.
I do it fast. And after I will open myself for everyone. Hope, you are open to new member.

  I have thought a lot about my expactation. I come that the most desirable is experience. Experience not only with my skills, but with new persons as well. They both are the most wished. Also I want find place for my ideas. They are so different. Here we stop.
  
Best Regards,
Ciril Stas`
